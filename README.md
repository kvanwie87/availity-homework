## Availity Homework
##### Question #1
*Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can be a personal or school project.*<br>
*Answer:* This year I became a Gold Pillar at Mindtree which means I had maintained a 4.5+/5 on my performance reviews for 4 years. It is pretty difficult to maintain 4.5+ so there is usually only about 3 or 4 Gold Pillars at Mindtree's Gainesville center. But honestly that is more people being proud of me than me being proud of myself. What I am really most proud of was an award I got in my second year of community college. I didn't know what I was going to major in and just decided to take some introductory programming courses on a whim. It really clicked with me and I performed very well in those courses. At the end of the spring semester the professors give rewards for the best student in each department and I received it for the Computer Science department. I was very proud of it and it really cemented me in pursuing a Degree in Computer Science.
##### Question #2
*Tell me a about a book, blog, article or GitHub repo you read or liked recently, and why you like it and why you should recommend I do the same.*<br>
*Answer:* I would say about 95% of the technical reading I do online is stackoverflow or some random tutorial while I would definitely recommend them but it isn't particularly interesting unless you are facing the same technical issue. My remaining technical reading is generally tangential to whatever I'm doing at work. Recently it has been reading about augmented reality and tinkering with Vuforia in Unity to try to make little AR apps. The goal being for me and my girlfriend to work on some sort of AR app that has something to do with smart cities but we are still at the drawing board. Below is a link for Vuforia that I would recommend because it isn't to difficult to get started and lets you dabble in AR without needing much background in computer vision. While AR is an emerging technology and limited by the existing hardware it will likely have more day to day applications once the hardware evolves and becomes more ubiquitous. <br>

##### Question #3
*If you were to describe to a 7-year old what Availity does, what would you say?*<br>
*Answer:* I didn't have much background or general knowledge in the Healthcare or Insurance fields but what I have gathered is Availity at a high level is middleware between healthcare providers and healths plan that eases communication. If I were to explain this to a 7 year old I would say providers and health plans are like towns on opposite sides of a roaring river (which is all the healthcare data, rules, regulations, etc) and Availity is like a ferry which the two sides rely on to interact.
