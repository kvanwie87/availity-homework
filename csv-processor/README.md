## CSV Processor
This solution was written using Apache Spark with Scala.<br>
The requirements didn't specify any particular technology to use. Writing some core Java file io parsing code I figure would not scale to production sized data and would take significant effort.
 Data pipeline or ETL requirements like this problem statement seemed best accomplished by tools designed for it. I opted for Spark because I have dabbled in it and this requirement was pretty simple to accomplish in Spark.<br>
